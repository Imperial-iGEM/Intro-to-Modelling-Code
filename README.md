![academic_bot](./static/academic_bot.gif)

As part of Imperial College London's IGEM 2020 human practises, we developed an **Introduction to Mathematical Modelling in Synthetic Biology** package. Included in this package are coding challenges. This repository contains the solution code for those challenges (Cch_ files) and the [full introduction package](./T--Imperial_College--introtomodelling.pdf)

### Get started

We are currently working on expanding our video tutorials - check them out [here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLTzF6JV_DoE2Nuhbmt52nTYaCz-roHNUl)
