# Intro-to-Modelling-Code

As part of Imperial College London's IGEM 2020 human practises, we developed an Introduction to Mathematical Modelling in Synthetic Biology package. Included in this package are coding challenges. This repository contains the solution code for those challenges.

We are currently working on expanding our video tutorials - check them out [here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLTzF6JV_DoE2Nuhbmt52nTYaCz-roHNUl)

For more information about the package, visit our wiki and head to [Education](https://2020.igem.org/Team:Imperial_College/Education).
